issues :
the sorting is in alphabetical order
the program checks for brackets before 
the thing is sent to be sorted if its there program doesnt run
the programme only executes after sorting.
observation it is possible to get into the /bin folder
you use a command to sort it so you need to bypass the command.

Another observation is that the sorting is done not by python but by a bashscript
which sorts according to the order.
if it is an issue of the bash script the error number is 1
whereas if it the issue of the shell the error code is 0
Stuff within the quotes is the only part that is read in

if bash recognises a command then it would take others as arguements
